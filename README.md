Catfight is a simple Python game that I created for a university project. It was my first time using Python to program a game. This project implements a game similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors, where players can compete against each other or against the computer. The game determines the winner based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

Rules to the game :
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beat Paper
- Paper beats Rock
COMBOS :
If a player manages to successfully win against their opponent with 3 same picks, without taking any damage, they can score a combo, damaging their opponent for more health than usual.

CONTROLS :
Player 1:
A - Rock
S - Paper
D - Scissors
Player 2:
← (Arrow Left) - Rock
↑ (Arrow Up) - Paper
→ (Arrow Right) - Scissors
